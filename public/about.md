## About Me

I have over seven years of experience as a software engineer and technical lead across multiple projects. Curiosity is one of my biggest strengths, which has allowed me to get involved in the entire software development stack: web frontend and backend development, mobile app development, infrastructure engineering, QA and performance/load testing. I'm a generalist and believe in using the right tool for the right job.

I'm from [Ensenada, México](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada,_Baja_California), but currently reside in San Francisco, CA.

### My Professional Career  

I currently work at [Tacit Knowledge Inc.](http://www.tacitknowledge.com) in San Francisco. We focus on ecommerce and content management projects for big retailers in the US and UK, with strong focus on software development best practices. With Tacit I've had the opportunity to work with clients such as Target, Nike, Converse, Williams Sonoma and Kodak, to name a few.

During my career I've been mostly involved in Java based web application development using frameworks like Adobe AEM, Endeca, hybris and ATG. However, over the last couple of years I've been focusing more on iOS projects, which has reignited my joy for programming.  I was tech lead and key contributor for the redesign of the [Target for iPad app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/target-for-ipad/id402742793?mt=8_) which we released to the app store in November 2014. The app was very well received by the public in general (4 stars) as well as by the media.  

In a past life I worked at [Softtek](http://www.softtek.com/) writing Adobe Flex applications and before that I worked at [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/mx/es/) maintaining AS400 legacy commands. 

### Open Source

I'm the main author and maintainer for the [JCR-Mock](https://github.com/tacitknowledge/jcr-mock) library for mocking JCR compliant repositories.  

### Side Projects  

My curiosity has also helped me get involved in a number of interesting side projects. Most notably I participated on a Burning Man art installation ([Hands by Dave Gertler](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/pictures/burning-man-2013-the-people-20130905/stiltwalkers-0795928)). I worked on the wiring and installation for the ligthing and was in charge of writing the firmware.  I also wrote an iPad app for controlling the LEDs using bluetooth technology.  You can read more about that on my <a href="/articles/hands_(part_i)">blog posts</a>.  

My current side project is a cash monitoring system and web console for internet kiosks in México, using Java and Ruby on Rails.

## About Me

I have over seven years of experience as a software engineer and technical lead across multiple projects. Curiosity is one of my biggest strengths, which has allowed me to get involved in the entire software development stack: web frontend and backend development, mobile app development, infrastructure engineering, QA and performance/load testing.  

### My Professional Career  

Professionally, I've been mostly involved in Java based web application development in the ecommerce and content management space using tools like Adobe CQ5, Endeca and ATG.  

However, over the last couple of years I've been focusing more on iOS projects, which has reignited my joy for programming.  I was tech lead and key contributor for the redesign of the [Target for iPad app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/target-for-ipad/id402742793?mt=8_) which we released to the app store in November 2014. The app was very well received by the public in general (4 stars) as well as by the media.  

### Side Projects  

My curiosity has also helped me get involved in a number of interesting side projects. Most notably I participated on a Burning Man art installation ([Hands by Dave Gertler](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/pictures/burning-man-2013-the-people-20130905/stiltwalkers-0795928)). I worked on the wiring and installation for the ligthing and was in charge of writing the firmware.  I also wrote an iPad app for controlling the LEDs using bluetooth technology.  You can read more about that on my <a href="/articles/hands_(part_1)">blog posts</a>.  

Currently, I'm working on a cash monitoring system and web console for internet kiosks in MÃ©xico, using Java and Ruby on Rails.
